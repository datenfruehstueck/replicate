# Replication Management

Collect and list student replications.


## What's that?

An easy-to-use and easy-to-install tool to have students add their replicative studies and list them to the public.

## Installation

Copy the files to a PHP-ready server, install a MySQL database (using database.sql) and adapt config.php accordingly.

## Great idea!

Thanks, but it's not ours. We've originally seen it at Uni Leipzig (https://home.uni-leipzig.de/lerep).
