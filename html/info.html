    <strong>Replications</strong> and <strong>reproductions</strong> are main tools of scientific research. They adhere to the scientific principle that research needs to be intersubjective. That is, if two studies are conducted exactly the same way, their findings should match.
</p>
<p>
	Differences between replications and reproductions are subtle but important in that <a href="https://forrt.org/glossary/english/replicability/">replications</a> describe the repetition of a study's design and method by another scholar using new data whereas <a href="https://forrt.org/glossary/english/reproducibility/">reproductions</a> describe the redoing of an original study's analysis through its original data. The respective field of meta science (or, the science of sciences) has also brought forward more detailled distinctions, separating <abbr title="recollecting data from a sample most similar to the original one" class="initialism">direct</abbr> from <abbr title="deviating from the original study very carefully in one or two meaningful instances" class="initialism">conceptual</abbr> replications and <abbr title="using the original study's analysis script and essentially just hitting that 'run' button" class="initialism">computational</abbr> from <abbr title="rebuilding the analysis script by following the original study's method section closely" class="initialism">recreate</abbr> reproductions. 
</p>

    Obviously, there are a lot of determinators that may prevent such matching findings. For example, news consumption today is drastically different from news consumption some twenty years ago. Hence, studies replicating prior studies are, surprisingly often, doomed to fail (see, for example, McEwan, Carpenter, & Westermann, 2018). However, they are not only failing because of changing circumstances but potentially due to a wide array of reasons, human error also being one of them. In fact Artner and colleagues (2021) showed from a series of reproductions that it is often copy-and-paste errors or rounding mistakes that inhibit successful reproductions.

<p>
    Several other problems could occur when trying to reproduce or replicate studies. For example, original data could be unavailable (e.g., due to legal reasons) or the recollection of data could be impossible (e.g., because it studied a now-offline platform) for a replication. Also, sometimes effort put into an original study simply is too much to handle for a reproduction/replication. In any case, reproductions and replications are crucial yet have been largely ignored in communication science so far (Breuer & Haim, 2024; Dienlin et al., 2021).
</p>
<p>
    This platform is to display efforts to reproduce and replicate studies in communication science, not least by students. We believe that students are well-capable of either reproducing or replicating studies in communication science, thus not learning a lot from these endeavors but also conributing to science's overarching rigor and, ultimately, credibility.
